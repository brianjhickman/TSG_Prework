LAB ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
----------------------------

In this exercise, you will apply the equations for calculating heights and widths as discussed in the Box Model lesson.

The sample element you are working with is:

#div1 {
    height: 150px;
    width: 400px;
    margin: 20px;
    border: 1px solid red;
    padding: 10px;
}

For this object, calculate:

1) Total height
2) Total width
3) Browser calculated height
4) Browser calculated width

Save your answers in a file named BoxModelCalculations.txt and be sure to show your work as to how you arrived at the answers.
Add this file to your local repository and check it into your GitHub repository.

MY CALCULATIONS(*):
-------------------

1) TOTAL HEIGHT = margin-top + border-top + padding-top + (height of the content) + padding-bottom + border-bottom + margin-bottom
   Total height = 20 + 1 + 10 + 150 + 10 + 1 + 20 = 212px

2) TOTAL WIDTH = margin-left + border-left + padding-left + (width of the content) + padding-right + border-right + margin-right
   Total width = 20 + 1 + 10 + 400 + 10 + 1 + 20 = 462px

3) BROWSER CALCULATED HEIGHT = border-top + padding-top + (height of the content) + padding-bottom + border-bottom
   Browser calculated height = 1 + 10 + 150 + 10 + 1 = 172px

4) BROWSER CALCULATED WIDTH = border-left + padding-left + (width of the content) + padding-right + border-right
   Browser calculated width = 1 + 10 + 400 + 10 + 1 = 422px
